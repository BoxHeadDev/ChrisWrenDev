## âš¡ About Me

I'm currently on a gap year â€” not the backpacking kind, but the "rebuild-my-brain" kind. After a few solid years as a Full Stack Engineer at BT, working on the ee.co.uk website (yeah, that one), I've hit pause to dive deep into something thatâ€™s been calling my name: distributed systems and Rust.

Think less CSS bugs and more consensus algorithms and memory safety.

- ðŸ§  **Current Focus:** Learning Rust + Distributed Systems from the ground up
- ðŸ”§ **Past Life:** Full Stack Engineer at BT, making sure your EE checkout didn't crash mid-iPhone purchase
- ðŸ’¥ **What I'm Breaking Now:** Paxos, Raft, async runtimes, and my comfort zone
- ðŸ¦€ **Why Rust?** Because segfaults and race conditions should be a thing of the past
- â˜• **Still Powered By:** Copious amounts of coffee and "wait... how does this even work?"
