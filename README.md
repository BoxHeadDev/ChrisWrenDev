## ⚡ About Me

I'm a Full Stack Engineer over at **BT**, working on the **ee.co.uk** website — you know, the site everyone in the UK relies on to buy their phones and broadband. I like to think of myself as a digital handyman, building stuff that actually works (most of the time 😅).

- 🏢 **Day Job:** Full Stack Engineer at BT
- 📱 **Main Gig:** Building and maintaining the EE website checkout, making sure it doesn't break when you’re paying for your next iphone.
- 🏆 **Superpower:** Breaking things and then fixing them with a cup of coffee in hand ☕️
